# Time Series Forecasting Pipeline v3

This project provides a reproducible pipeline for forecasting monthly consumption of various products using three different time series models: ARIMA, SARIMAX, and RandomForest. This version incorporates an exogenous variable (`mes_picos`) to better capture seasonal peaks.

## How to Run

1.  **Data Prerequisite:** This script assumes you have already run the first pipeline and that the `output/excel/filtered_data.xlsx` file exists.
2.  **Install dependencies:** Run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas openpyxl statsmodels scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```
3.  **Run the pipeline:** Execute the main script from the root directory:
    ```bash
    python3 src/forecasting_pipeline_v3.py
    ```

## Outputs

*   **Evaluation Metrics:** A summary of model performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE) and the best model for each product is saved to `output/excel/evaluation_metrics.xlsx`.
*   **Future Predictions:** The future forecasts from October 2025 to December 2026, generated by the best model for each product, are saved to `output/excel/future_predictions.xlsx`.
*   **Plots:** Professional visualizations of the historical data, test set predictions, and future forecasts for each product are saved as PNG images in the `output/plots/` directory.
